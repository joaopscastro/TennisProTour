# CLAUDE.md — Tennis Manager RPG

This file gives Claude Code the context that was built up over a planning
session in claude.ai chat, before any code was committed to this repo.
Read this in full before making architectural decisions — it captures
*why*, not just *what*, and several decisions here reverse an earlier,
less-considered version (e.g. the live-scoring approach), so don't
re-derive from first principles without checking this first.

See also: `docs/business-plan.md` (or wherever `tennis-manager-rpg-plan.md`
gets placed in this repo) for the full business/market rationale. This
file is the technical/architectural distillation of that document.

## Project one-liner
A free, fair (non-pay-to-win), browser-first tennis manager RPG —
positioned as "Rocking Rackets, rebuilt and maintained" — targeting the
orphaned community of Rocking Rackets and Online Tennis Manager, two
long-unmaintained browser games with active but underserved players.

## Non-negotiable design principles

1. **Money buys convenience and cosmetics, never an unconditional
   win-rate boost.** Where a paid perk does touch competitiveness (e.g.
   extra roster slots), it must be paired with a real, built-in cost
   (e.g. faster stat/point decay) — never a flat unlock. This is
   modeled directly on Rocking Rackets' own VIP system, which is
   genuinely well-designed on this front.
2. **Avoid the Football Manager complexity trap.** No 3D/graphical
   match engine, no deep tactical instruction trees, no board-politics
   or press-conference sub-games, no attempt to model real players or a
   real-world database. Text/stat-based results (closer to 1992's
   original Championship Manager) are enough — that's *why* the genre
   is addictive in the first place, not despite it.
3. **Avoid the Tribal Wars destructive-PvP trap.** Competition should
   feel like Rocking Rackets' point-decay ranking system (you fall in
   rank, you don't get wiped out) — not elimination-style conquest.
   Also avoid Tribal Wars' sprawling building/unit tech-tree; the
   existing stat model (technical/physical/mental + surface affinity)
   is the right scope, don't expand it without a specific reason.
4. **No real-time infrastructure for match viewing. This is the most
   important scalability decision made so far — do not reintroduce
   WebSockets/SSE for live scoring without revisiting this document
   first.** Matches are fully simulated synchronously the moment
   they're due (triggered by a scheduled job, never by a live viewer
   request), producing an immutable replay log (game-by-game score
   deltas + relative timestamps). The frontend fetches that log once
   via a normal HTTP GET and fakes the live experience client-side on a
   timer — exactly Rocking Rackets' own "pre-simulated, frontend fakes
   live" pattern. This makes viewer count irrelevant to backend cost,
   which is the single biggest lever for supporting many concurrent
   game-worlds cheaply.
5. **Hexagonal architecture / ports & adapters, strictly.** `domain/`
   has zero framework or infrastructure imports, ever. Application
   layer depends only on ports (interfaces); adapters implement them.
   Different bounded contexts only ever reference each other by ID
   (`PlayerId`, `TournamentId`, etc.), never by importing another
   context's aggregate directly.
6. **SOLID discipline, actively enforced, not just aspired to:**
   - Repository interfaces are split per aggregate (`PlayerRepository`,
     `TournamentRepository`), not one shared god-interface (ISP).
   - Domain services (like `PlayerAgingService`) exist separately from
     entities specifically when the logic is a swappable *policy*
     (different aging curves for fast vs. slow game-worlds), not
     because "services" are a default pattern to reach for (SRP + OCP).
   - `MatchSimulator` is an interface a concrete class implements, so a
     future, more elaborate simulator can replace
     `StatisticalMatchSimulator` without touching any caller (OCP +
     DIP).
   - **Never reach into an aggregate's private state via an `as unknown
     as {...}` cast from outside the aggregate.** This happened twice
     during the initial domain-model build and was caught both times —
     add a proper public accessor method on the aggregate instead
     (e.g. `Tournament.getScheduledMatch()`).

## Committed stack (with rationale — see full plan doc for the "why not X" reasoning)

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Domain/application | Plain TypeScript, framework-agnostic |
| API framework | Fastify (not NestJS — its DI container tends to fight hexagonal boundaries) |
| ORM / DB | Drizzle + PostgreSQL (not Prisma — less codegen magic, cleaner repository adapters) |
| Scheduled jobs | BullMQ + Redis |
| "Live" match viewing | No WebSockets/SSE — pre-simulate + replay log + client-side fake-live playback (see principle #4) |
| Replay log storage | Object storage (S3/R2) behind a CDN, or Postgres JSON column at small scale |
| Billing | Stripe, behind a `BillingPort` interface |
| Frontend | Next.js/React — chosen for DX as a solid React default, not because the logged-in dashboard needs SSR (it's really an SPA behind auth; SSR mainly benefits the public marketing page) |
| Notifications | Email (Postmark/Resend) + push (OneSignal), triggered by domain events |
| Hosting | One provider for everything at MVP (Railway or Fly.io) — do not split Next.js onto Vercel and the API/worker onto a second platform yet; that's a two-platform ops burden with no benefit at this scale |

## Monorepo layout
```
tennis-manager/
  packages/
    domain/        # bounded contexts, framework-free
    application/   # use cases + ports, one folder per context
  apps/
    api/           # Fastify HTTP adapters (inbound) + Drizzle/Stripe adapters (outbound)
    worker/        # BullMQ job handlers: weekly ticks, aging, match simulation batch runs
    web/           # Next.js frontend (manager dashboard + marketing page)
```

## Bounded contexts
1. **Player & Roster** — player entities, stats, aging, training. ✅ domain skeleton built.
2. **Competition** — tournaments, brackets, rankings, match scheduling. ✅ domain skeleton built.
3. **Match Simulation Engine** — deterministic sim, pure domain logic, no I/O. ✅ domain skeleton built.
4. **Manager & Progression** — manager XP, staff, scouting. ⬜ not started (only a stubbed seam via `maxRosterSizeFor` in `HirePlayerUseCase`).
5. **Billing** — Stripe subscriptions/one-offs, entitlements. ⬜ not started (`BillingPort` referenced but not yet defined).
6. **Notifications** — push/email digest, decoupled via events. ⬜ not started.
7. **Social** — guilds/academies, chat, leaderboards. ⬜ not started.

## What's already built (in `domain-model/` at repo root, or wherever it's placed)
- `domain/shared/ids.ts` — branded ID types (`PlayerId`, `TournamentId`, etc.), `GameWeek` value object.
- `domain/shared/DomainEvent.ts` — marker interface for domain events.
- `domain/player/PlayerAttributes.ts` — `Skill`, `SurfaceAffinities`, `PlayerAttributes` value objects.
- `domain/player/Player.ts` — `Player` aggregate root.
- `domain/player/PlayerAgingService.ts` — policy-driven weekly aging/decline domain service.
- `domain/competition/CompetitionTypes.ts` — `TournamentTier`, `MatchOutcome`, `MatchLog`/`MatchLogEntry` (the fake-live replay data), `BracketRound`.
- `domain/competition/Tournament.ts` — `Tournament` aggregate root, bracket integrity.
- `domain/match-simulation/MatchSimulator.ts` — `MatchSimulator` port, `RandomSource` port, `SimulatedMatch` type.
- `domain/match-simulation/StatisticalMatchSimulator.ts` — concrete deterministic implementation; emits both `MatchOutcome` and `MatchLog`.
- `application/ports/ports.ts` — `PlayerRepository`, `TournamentRepository`, `ClockPort`, `EventPublisherPort`, `MatchLogStorePort`.
- `application/use-cases/HirePlayerUseCase.ts`, `SimulateMatchUseCase.ts`.

All of the above passes `npx tsc --noEmit --strict --target ES2020 --module commonjs` with zero errors. Re-run this check after any change to `domain/` or `application/`.

## Known placeholders that need real tuning (not architectural — safe to leave for now, but don't ship without revisiting)
- `PlayerAgingService`'s stage thresholds (prime/decline/retirement ages) are illustrative, not balanced.
- `StandardRankingPointsTable`'s points formula is illustrative, not balanced.
- ~~`StatisticalMatchSimulator`'s scoring loop treats each simulated "point" as directly incrementing a game count, skipping real game-by-game/deuce structure.~~ **Fixed**: every game (and tiebreak) is now played out as a real point-by-point sequence — 0/15/30/40, deuce, advantage, sudden-death tiebreak scoring — with unit tests asserting the point-score sequence at every step, not just the final winner (see `StatisticalMatchSimulator.test.ts`). `MatchLog` gained a `points` array (`MatchPointEntry[]`) alongside the existing game-completion `entries` rollup, which is unchanged and still what the bracket/scrub-bar tick marks consume. What's still a placeholder, not yet fixed: the underlying point-win-probability formula (`effectiveRating`'s attribute weights, the `/15` sigmoid divisor) is illustrative, not balanced — it's the credibility core of the whole game and still worth a dedicated tuning pass before launch, players will forgive UI roughness far more than a sim that "feels rigged."

## Immediate next steps (in rough order)
1. `BracketGenerator` domain service (single-elimination seeding) for the Competition context.
2. Monorepo scaffolding per the layout above.
3. Postgres/Drizzle adapters implementing `PlayerRepository` and `TournamentRepository`.
4. Define `BillingPort` and a `StripeAdapter` implementing it.
5. Unit tests for `StatisticalMatchSimulator` with a fixed `RandomSource` stub, before any balance tuning.
6. Object-storage adapter implementing `MatchLogStorePort`.

## Context on the person building this
Software engineer, hexagonal/clean architecture background, comfortable
with agentic MCP pipelines. This is a side venture explored alongside an
existing FC Porto media platform (Mercado Azul) and freelance work — the
explicit goal stated at the start of this project was to **avoid
over-engineering and unnecessary complexity**, which is why principles
#2, #3, and #4 above exist: each one is a deliberate reaction against a
genuinely tempting but wrong level of scope (Football Manager's depth,
Tribal Wars' systems sprawl, real-time infrastructure).
